# EDA Approach:

Generally 2 types of data types we can see in Data-Science.
- **`Numeric`**: Data that are expressed on a numeric scale.
    - **Continuous**: Data that can take on any value in an interval.
    - **Discrete:** Data that can take on only integer values, such as counts
- **`Categorical`**: Data that can take on only a specofic set of values representing a set of possible categories.
    - **Binary**: A special case of categorical data with just two categories of values e.g., 0/1, true/false.
    - **Ordinal**: Categorical data that has an explicit ordering.
