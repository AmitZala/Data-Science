    number is greater than equal to 4, what is the probability of getting an even number?
24. Suppose I have 10 numbers. In these 10 numbers I add 5 to all these numbers. Then what 
    will happen with mean, variance, median, standard deviation.

2.  How mean is different from median?
3.  What is MinMax Scaler?
4.  How standard scaler is different from MinMax scaler?

9.  is KNN supervised algorithm or not? Decision tree? How the decision tree is difference
    from linear regression model?
10. What is multicollinearity and why it is a problem? What will happen if we have 2 variables which has
    highly correlation to the linear model, explain in mathematically?
11. If there is a regression model saying y = β0 + β1x1 + b2x2 + ... How do you explain these
    β0, β1, β2... to someone? Lets say β1 = 1.2 How do you explain this to business?
12. What are the assumptions for regression model?
13. Can you explain the PCA? How it works internally?
14. How the covariance is different from correlation?
15. Measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. What is the impact of variance like
    (high variance & low variance) to build ML model?
16. Difference between addition and multiplication rule in probability?
17. what is Conditional probability?
18. What is the Normal Distribution? First standard deviasion (68.3% data lies in between -1 to +1 std) 
    using example.
19. How is different the numpy array from python list? lets say a = [1, 2, 3, 4]. How do you 
    change the 2 to your name?
20. How does insert operation works in python list?
21. Your jupyter notebook code, how do I use that to other ide like spider or in plain python?
22. Suppose you have wrote a very good function. I want to use that code. How do you give me that?

1.  How do you think encoding is necessary? How does it help? Is it applicable to all the 
    algorihms or few of the them?
2.  What is a regression model?
3.  How Random Forest algorithm works? In your data, there are 10k rows and 30 features. You 
    take this data and train a Random Forest model and tomorrow I want to predict. How this
    entire flow works?
4.  How Random Forest is different from Decision Tree?

6.  How median is related to the percentile?
7.  Odd ratio
8.  Addition rule and multiplication rule in probability.
9.  Let's say there is a class of 5 students and I took a test. I got an average marks. Later
    I realized that I forgot to add the marks of one student. So, if I include that marks,
    what will happen with the average marks?
10. How the variance is different from standard division? If I have variance, then why do
    we need standard deviasion.

    file names in one list.
16. In a patient data, there are two columns named age and gender. I want to create a new 
    column where I want to create flag value say if female is 30+ then the flag value is 1
    otherwise 0. How to do that?
17. What is the differences between numpy and pandas? Which is used to which purpose?
18. In Pandas, lets say there is patient data. From that data I want to see what is the number
    of appoinments in one column for person by person. One person take one appoinment, other person take
    2 appoinments. Gender column is also there. I want to see average number of appoinments
    for male and what is the average number of appoinments for female?
19. How do you define the difference of inner join from left outer join? (SQL)
20. You are working in an organization where customers can book doctors' appoinment. The app
    is good for few states in India and not good to some other states. Lets say you are a
    business development person. That app is not good for Gujurat but good for Dehli, 
    Hariyama. What approach you will take, how will you collect data and what recommendation
    from your side for the organization that it can capture the market of Gujurat?
